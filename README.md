- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nategy
  I am currently a senior at Texas State University and I am majoring in Computer Science.
  When there is an opportunity I take advantage and learn as much as I can. I am currently
  focused on working with the Three.js and React.js library and creating 3D models to use 
  in websites. The most recent project I am proud of and am currently working on is creating
  an add on to a website for an event planner in Austin, Texas. The project is in the works 
  and is the most recent file in my repository.
  
  I am familiar with the following languages...
  C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
