Hi, I’m Nason.

I’m an IT Dallas Manager / Jr. Network & Systems Administrator and full-stack developer who likes building practical tools for real environments—store networks, support teams, and small businesses. I work a lot with React, Three.js, and AWS to turn ideas into dashboards, 3D configurators, and automation.

## Recent Work

- **UniFi Store Network Health Dashboard** – AWS Lambda + DynamoDB + QuickSight to visualize WAN latency, client counts, and offline devices for supermarket stores.
- **AWS Lex IT Support Chatbot** – Bilingual (English/Spanish) bot that guides store staff through common IT issues using internal SOPs.
- **Party Fascinations 3D Event Configurator** – React/Three.js tool that lets customers design and visualize event layouts in 3D.

## Tech I Use

- **Languages:** JavaScript/TypeScript, C++, Java, HTML, CSS  
- **Cloud & Tools:** AWS (Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, QuickSight, Lex), Git/GitHub  
- **Frontend:** React, Three.js, modern CSS
